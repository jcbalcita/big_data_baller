# BigDataBaller

## nb.
This project is one big prototype at this point. Don't expect professional quality code, or tests for that matter. 

## TODO

- ~~Grab all box scores from 1995-96 to the present and put onto S3 in json format~~
- ~~Convert box scores to parquet format~~
- Add additional statistics (e.g., opposing team stats, matchup stats)

Data will be used for machine learning at some point.
